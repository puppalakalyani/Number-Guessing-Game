# Number Guessing Game Development Journey

## Project Overview
A web-based Number Guessing Game that challenges players to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

## Development Steps Completed

### 1. Initial Project Setup
- Created basic HTML structure for the game interface
- Implemented JavaScript game logic in `scripts/main.js`
- Added CSS styling in `styles/style.css`

### 2. Project Structure Improvements
- Reorganized files into `scripts/` and `styles/` directories
- Ensured proper file references in HTML
- Added console logging for easier testing

### 3. Testing Enhancements
- Created `test.js` with automated testing framework
- Added test cases to verify game functionality:
  - Checking low guess scenarios
  - Verifying high guess scenarios
  - Testing correct number guessing

### 4. Version Control
- Initialized Git repository
- Created `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files
- Prepared repository for GitHub push

## Key Features
- Random number generation between 1-100
- Real-time guess feedback
- Attempt tracking
- Simple and intuitive user interface

## Future Improvements
- Add difficulty levels
- Implement high score tracking
- Create more comprehensive test cases

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Start guessing!

## Testing
- Open browser console
- Run tests in `test.js` to verify game mechanics
